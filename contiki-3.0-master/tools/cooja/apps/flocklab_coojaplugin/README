== Installation ==
The plugin is compatible with Cooja from the Contiki OS 3.0 release.
If you don't have Cooja yet, you can dowload it from github:

git clone https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki.git
cd contiki
git submodule update --init

Start Cooja:
cd <cooja dir>
ant run

You can activate the FlockLab plugin by in the menu "Settings->Cooja Extensions..."
A restart of Cooja might be required to apply the configuration.

== Use the Plugin ==
The work flow for the plugin is a bit different from the usual Cooja work flow. Instead of creating a simulation, the plugin directly loads test result data:
1. Download your test results and extract it
2. Tell the FlockLab plugin to load your data using the "Tools->FlockLan Visualizer..." menu
